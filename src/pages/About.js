        I am a Full Stack Web Developer; graduating from a full stack bootcamp
        through University of Chapel Hill. Graduating with knowledge in
        JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MySQL, React, etc. Currently working
        as an veterinary technician at an emergency animal hospital. Curiosity,
        desire to learn, self-motivation and creativity drove me to change my
        career path. Working in the veterinary medicine I have acquired many
        skills that transition into tech. The skills I have acquired are but not
        limited to critical thinking, love for research, patience, collaboration
        and communication. The goal is to find a company that can continue to
        nurture these skills, be apart of a company that will continue to let me
        grow. As well as, being able to find ways to add to a company and team.
        Reach out, I looked forward to speaking to you.
